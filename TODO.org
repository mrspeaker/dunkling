* TODO
** Figure out coordinates for realsy
- match coords to verts
** Fix terrain joining
- probably depends on figuring out coords
** Score display when boulder stops
** Allow early restart
** [DONE] Remove orbit cam when not orbit
- or something to fix the jitter
** Refix initial angled chunks
- maybe replace with mountain model
** Steer boulder
- all click on edge as it rotates to steer
  - only in air? ground too?
** Somehow slow down faster at end
