* TODO
** Don't allow "build" directly under stone
- to easy to cheese. Also physics goes nuts
** Figure out coordinates for realsy
-- 0.0.0 is where you start. 0.0.SHEET_TOTAL - CHUNK_SIZE is target
- match coords to verts  
** Fix terrain joining
- [done-ish]probably depends on figuring out coords
** [DONE] Score display when boulder stops
** Highscore.
** Allow early restart
- [DONE] hit ESC. need to make pause menu for reals though
** [DONE] Remove orbit cam when not orbit
- or something to fix the jitter
** Refix initial angled chunks
- maybe replace with mountain model
** Steer boulder
- all click on edge as it rotates to steer
  - only in air? ground too?
** Somehow slow down faster at end
[DONE] - added angulardamping (see constants)
