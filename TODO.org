* TODO
** DONE Reset camera on game-over
** TODO Fix 'dig-building' terrain sculpting
- when you build, it digs out the edges making a moat
** DONE Don't allow "build" directly under stone
- to easy to cheese. Also physics goes nuts
** DONE Figure out coordinates for realsy
-- 0.0.0 is where you start. 0.0.SHEET_TOTAL - CHUNK_SIZE is target
-- x = 0 is center of sheet, w/2 = left  of sheet, -w/2 = right of sheet
-- rigth is -ve, left is +ve (looking down sheet)
-- could flip this, but too much work now
- match coords to verts  
** [SORT OF DONE] Fix terrain joining
- Off-by-one
- TODO sculpting doesn't go over chunk boundaries
** DONE Score display when boulder stops
** DONE Highscore.
** [SORT OF DONE] Allow early restart
- DONE hit ESC to restart
- need to make pause menu for reals though
** [SORT OF DONE] Remove orbit cam when not orbit
- or something to fix the jitter
- Allow middel button orbit
- allow left-shift button zoom
** TODO Refix initial angled chunks
- replace with epic mountain model
** TODO Steer boulder in air?
- all click/rub on edge as it rotates to steer
  - only in air? ground too?
** DONE Somehow slow down faster at end
- added angulardamping (see constants)


* Ideas / to test
** "Floor is lava" mode
... try to get in the hole without hitting the ground
** Pinball-esque elements
flippers and bouncers that you either want to hit or avoid
** Roulette/Craps table
(Inspo: thor leaning over the side of the playing field looked like someone standing around a craps table, cheering the throw)

How about a gambling-type game, the play field city is divided up into city "zones" that also funciton as roulette or craps-type results (like the "evens" "odds", "black/red", "1to12"etc). Where the stone stops becomes the result of the roll. I don't konw how craps works, but I think this woul be the game to model it on: there's a strong "social interaction" part of that game (aparently)

That makes it "multiplayer" and maybe "twitch game-able"...

Perhaps player's bets are physical tokens in the play field (like, houses) and can be hit and moved by the stone.

- Ring closest to the hole is "the house" lol. Everyon lose.

- Don't use craps/roulette terminology- make up new ones. People love being in on secret languages (same as in horse racing) - everything should have a "come-in spinner", "come out roll"... and every outcome (eg "Big Red" == 7). "Stick calls are the phrases that the stickman, the casino staff member responsible for handling the dice, uses to announce the outcome of a roll in craps. eg “Eight, Skate and Donate!”: A fun way to announce an eight. "
  --- here's why someone on reddit likes craps: "The ability to control the pace of winning and losing. I can play a line bet, no odds. Or, I can play the line with odds, and fill up on (don't) come bets with odds. And, hop the easy ways or hi-lo-yo."
