* TODO
** [DONE] Don't allow "build" directly under stone
- to easy to cheese. Also physics goes nuts
** [DONE] Figure out coordinates for realsy
-- 0.0.0 is where you start. 0.0.SHEET_TOTAL - CHUNK_SIZE is target
-- rigth is -ve, left is +ve (looking down sheet)
- match coords to verts  
** [SORT OF DONE] Fix terrain joining
- Off-by-one
- sculpting doesn't go over chunk boundaries
** [DONE] Score display when boulder stops
** [DONE] Highscore.
** [SORT OF DONE] Allow early restart
- [DONE] hit ESC to restart
- need to make pause menu for reals though
** [SORT OF DONE] Remove orbit cam when not orbit
- or something to fix the jitter
- Allow middel button orbit, allow left-shift button zoom
** Refix initial angled chunks
- maybe replace with mountain model
** Steer boulder
- all click on edge as it rotates to steer
  - only in air? ground too?
** [DONE] Somehow slow down faster at end
- added angulardamping (see constants)
